## My Portfolio - Kathryn H.

This is a work in progress. A place for me to collect projects that I've done and other items of interest. I will be adding to this site over time.

### IBM Coursera Data Science Capstone Project
#### Description
The repository is for the IBM Coursera Applied Data Science capstone project.  
Objective: "Come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve."  
I chose to use KMeans to cluster the 100 most populated metropolitan areas.

### My graduate research paper on Matroid theorey.
#### Abstract
Matroids were introduced in 1935 by Hassler Whitney. Matroid theory is an active area of research and incorporates concepts from algebra, geometry, combinatorics, and graph theory. This paper includes definitions and examples of matroids, an important theorem of matroid theory, Whitney’s 2-isomorphism theorem, an application of using matroids for combinatorial optimization, and a version of the Greedy Algorithm written in the Sage programming language.

### You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/KathrynDH/kathryndh.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/KathrynDH/kathryndh.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
